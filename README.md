# MySevev ("My Rotation")
### An Android app (developed for fun) that helps keep track of a weekly rotation.
  
      
       
MySevev (=“My Rotation” in Hebrew) helps you keep track of a weekly rotation (hosting an event, giving a lecture, etc), and writes a personalized message to whoever is leading that week.
   
FEATURES:
- The list of people is automatically sorted by least-recent
- Personalized messages are created by selecting unassigned 
   Shabats, and can be exported directly (see screenshots).
- Automatically strikes-thru Shabats that have passed
- Weekly Shabats are loaded (with dates) for entire year!
   
HOW TO USE:   
(1) Click “Add Person”. After adding people -   
(2) Select a person, click “Ask”, and select which Shabats to ask for - and receive pre-written personalized message!    
(3) Hit “Share!” to export directly.    
(4) When he/she answers you, select the Shabat and person and click “Assign”. The app will reorganize the people list for you.     
(5) Don’t forget to hit “Remind” (select Person) leading up to the event (and receive a personalized msg)!    
        
    
This App was developed by someone who has organized too many communal events and loves software solutions for day-to-day problems 😃.
   
Would love to hear any feedback! This is a work in progress...
